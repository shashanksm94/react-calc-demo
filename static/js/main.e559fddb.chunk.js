Wait! Now what is a DOM? DOM is Document Object Model. JavaScript deals directly with the DOM where you can edit elements using their ID or class. Just think of the DOM as all that there is on the web page. React has its own virtual DOM. It does not alter the browser DOM directly. Assume for a particular instant that the React Virtual DOM is the same as the browser's DOM. And you click on a button. Traditional JavaScript can handle such events directly and load the relevant DOM elements. But React does not. React handles all events generated through the React's components. Then based on your event logic, it alters its virtual DOM (, only the part that needs to change). It then compares the virtual DOM to the browser DOM, identifies what part of the browser DOM needs to be changed, and makes the change. This might seem too long, but it's not.
